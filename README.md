# Bootic JS API Client

Pure Javascript, modern client for the [Bootic API](https://api.bootic.net), for Node.js and the browser.

# Usage

The following example prints the data for the last order placed in the first shop (accessible for your auth token's scope).

``` js
const bootic = require('bootic')

bootic
  .auth('bearer', { accessToken: 'aabbcc...xxyyzz' })
  .then(function(root) {
    return root.shops.first()
  })
  .then(function(shop) {
    return shop.orders.last()
  })
  .then(function(order) {
    console.log(order)
  })
```

Or for a more advanced example, let's say we want to hide all products contained in the 'Offers' collection.

``` js
bootic
  .auth({ clientId: '123abc...', clientSecret: 'zxy321...' }) // credentials strategy
  .then(function(root) {
    // both callback and promises are allowed.
    root.shops.first(function(shop) {
      console.log(`Processing ${shop.subdomain}`) // Entity attribute

      // follow `products` link, that returns a collection and iterate over items
      shop.products.where(collection: 'Offers').each(function(product) {

        // and call the `update` action
        product.update(status: 'hidden').then(function(res) {
          console.log(res)
        })
      })
    })
```

## Install

    npm install -g bootic (or yarn add)

## Authentication

In order to access the API your need to create an application or enable the developer sandbox at [https://auth.bootic.net](auth.bootic.net). 

Once you've done so, you initialize the client by calling:

`.auth(strategy, opts)`

Initializes the client with the given options and `strategy` provided. `strategy` can be either `bearer`, `credentials` or `authorized`, or even skipped, in which case the strategy is deduced from the given credentials. For example:

`.auth('bearer', { accessToken: 'aabbcc...xxyyzz' })`

Or simply (if using the credentials strategy):

`.auth({ clientId: '123abc...', clientSecret: 'zxy321...' })`

Options:

 - `accessToken`: Required for `bearer` and `authorized` strategies. You can generate temporary tokens by enabling the [https://auth.bootic.net/dev/sandbox](developer sandbox).
 - `clientId`: For `credentials` and `authorized` strategies. You need to [https://auth.bootic.net/dev/apps](create a Bootic OAuth2 app) to get this.
 - `clientSecret`: Same as above.
 - `rootUrl`: To use an alternate endpoint for the API root. You probably won't use this.
 - `strategy`: Yes, you can also pass it as an option. Not required.

For a detailed description about the supported OAuth2 strategies, please check the [Authentication section](https://api.bootic.net/api/authentication/) from our API documentation.

## Using the client

Starting from the root Element (initialized using the response from the API's `rootUrl`), an Element has `attributes` (strings, numbers, dates, etc), `links`, and `embedded` items (which can be either other `Elements` or `Collections` of Elements). Links can either return other `Elements` or `Collections`, as with `embedded` items, but they can also perform actions on the current `Element` in which case a success/error status is returned.

This client supports chaining methods from Elements and Collections until a method is finally called. This means that both Elements and Collections can either be `Embedded` (its contents are known, since the data has already been received), `Linked` (unknown contents, linked from the current `Element`) or even `Virtual` (when the caller isn't Embedded but Virtual, e.g. `contact` in `shop.orders.first.contact`).

You can also browse through the Bootic API endpoints by using the HAL browser in [https://api.bootic.net/browser/](api.bootic.net/browser/). 

## CLI

Yes, this client sports a nice CLI interface that lets you perform stuff interactively. If you install the package globablly just run `bootic` and voil√°!

## Contributing

Report bugs at first sight! This is my first dive into the [Proxy object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) so your ride might get bumpy.

Please note that the interface might change in the future, so make sure to write tests (and run them) when you upgrade to a new major version (X.0.0).
